The Nextcloud Client is a file synchronization desktop utility. It synchronizes
files on your local computer, tablet, or hand-held device with an Nextcloud
Server. If you make a change to the files on one device, the change is
propagated to all other synchronized devices using the desktop synchronization
clients.

Normally, you start the client by clicking on the desktop icon or by starting
it from the client application menu. After starting, a Nextcloud icon appears
in the computer system tray or on your tablet or handheld device.

Nextcloud is an actively maintained fork of ownCloud.
