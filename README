The Nextcloud Client is a file synchronization desktop utility. It synchronizes
files on your local computer, tablet, or hand-held device with an Nextcloud
Server. If you make a change to the files on one device, the change is
propagated to all other synchronized devices using the desktop synchronization
clients.

Normally, you start the client by clicking on the desktop icon or by starting
it from the client application menu. After starting, a Nextcloud icon appears
in the computer system tray or on your tablet or handheld device.

Nextcloud is an actively maintained fork of ownCloud.

To download the latest source follow these instructions:

$ git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/client_theming.git
$ cd client_theming
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

Go for a coffee

$ cd ..
$ tar cvf client_theming-2.2.4.tar client_theming
$ gzip -v9f client_theming-2.2.4.tar
$ rm -rf client_theming

or get it from the link in the info file

This package optionally requires the Sphinx package in order to create
_owncloud_  man pages.

This slackbuild requires qtkeychain

Both Sphinx and qtkeychain are available from slackbuilds.org

The owncloud-client slackbuild on https://slackbuilds.org includes this note,
but I did not have time to test building on Qt5:

Note:  You must build this package against the same version of Qt that
       qtkeychain was built against.  This package will automatically build
       against qt4.  If you wish to build this package against qt5 then you
       must set the flag BUILD_WITH_QT4 to 'No' when building this package.
       For example:

       # BUILD_WITH_QT4=No ./nextcloud-client.SlackBuild
